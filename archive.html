      Happy Valentine's Day, my love! I'm so excited that I get to spend another year with you as my Valentine. It feels like almost no time at all has passed since our last Valentine's day, or even the one before that. At least we won't be seeing the Sonic movie, this time, right? I'm sure that whatever we end up doing to celebrate this year, it will be a wonderful time! We will probably end the day with a long session of cuddles, which I'm very much looking forward to. You always are so comfortable to hold and be with. It makes me really happy. Holding you has always been consistently one of my favorite things in the whole world over the past few years. We've made so many great memories together and I can't wait for all of the ones we'll make in the future, too. I have big plans for us, doll, don't you worry. I can't wait to keep being with you. 
      
      <br>There's been a lot going on for us this year, and especially you. I want to tell you how proud I am of you for sticking through all of the hard times even when things were really bad. You made it through the worst of it and I'm sure that life will be easier looking ahead. I'm elated to see your skin get better and you become happier and more energetic. I've been rooting for you all along and I will never stop being your biggest supporter as long as we're together. I love you with all my heart.
      
      <br>Ker blam,
      
      <br>Pogmeister Ultimoid

      <br>For real, though - Love,

      <br> Spencer
